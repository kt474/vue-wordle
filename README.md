# Vue Wordle

[Live demo](https://vue-wordle.netlify.app/)

A Vue implementation of the [Wordle game](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). Originally created by Evan You and forked from https://github.com/yyx990803/vue-wordle. 

You can make your own Wordle and send it to friends by base64-encoding a word and include it as the URL query, e.g. https://vue-wordle.netlify.app/?YmxpbXA= (this will also allow words that are not in the dictionary.)

This repository is open sourced for learning purposes only - the original creator(s) of Wordle own all applicable rights to the game itself.
